![Design preview for the Rock, Paper, Scissors challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this Rock, Paper, Scissors game against a bot and get it looking as close to the design as possible and deploy it.

### Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Git & GitHub

### Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size.
- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.
- Play with mouse, keyboard and touch screens.
- Maintain the state of the score after refreshing the browser.
- Introduce a GitHub username and watch the profille photo of that Github account.

### Rules

- Paper beats Rock.
- Rock beats Scissors.
- Scissors beats Paper.
- If the player wins, they gain 1 point. If the computer wins, the player loses one point.

### Resources

#### Design

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both mobile and desktop versions of the design to work to. Each file is also named depending on which step in the game the design is for.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

#### GitHub API

You'll need [GitHub API](https://api.github.com/) to get the user data, so at `/users/{username}` endpoint you will find the data needed.

### Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project.
3. Split your features in branches for a better git flow.
4. Mantain a clean code.
5. Use modern sintax.
6. Use animations.
7. Document your code with [jsdocs](https://jsdoc.app/).
8. Create a custom `README.md`. A custom `README` will help you explain your project and reflect on your learnings.

### Deploying your project

There are many ways to host your project for free. Recommend hosts are:

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
